Microsoft's built-in encryption mechanism for Windows devices is called BitLocker. Activating your BitLocker account is an important step in keeping sensitive data safe, whether you're doing it for personal safety or for business-level security. The phrase "BitLocker account" could be a little misleading because BitLocker doesn't need a separate account. Activation means turning on and configuring BitLocker for a specific user profile in Windows.

This post will show you how to turn on BitLocker the right way, how to set it up, and how to keep your encryption settings safe.

Before you turn on BitLocker, you need to know what it does.
Windows 10 and 11 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions all have BitLocker. It encrypts the whole disk drive so that no one can get in without permission. When you turn it on, the data on the disk can't be read without the right password or decryption key.

Turning on BitLocker on your computer makes it safer against:

Stealing devices

Accessing files without permission

Tampering with the system

Attacks that happen offline

You have to turn on BitLocker for it to work in the background.

Requirements for Activating BitLocker
Make sure your system matches these requirements before turning on BitLocker:

Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education is the version of Windows.

TPM (Trusted Platform Module): Version 1.2 or later is best.

BIOS/UEFI: Must support Secure Boot and TPM

Administrative access: You need to be an administrator to turn on BitLocker.

Microsoft account (optional): To back up your recovery key automatically

You can still turn on BitLocker with a USB key if your device doesn't have TPM, but it will take more steps.

How to Turn on BitLocker in Windows
To turn on and use BitLocker encryption on your computer, do the following:

Step 1: Go to the BitLocker settings
Go to Control Panel by clicking on the Start menu.

Click on System and Security, then BitLocker Drive Encryption.

Step 2: Pick a Drive
You will see a list of drives that are available. Pick the drive you wish to encrypt. The C: drive is usually the one you want to encrypt (where Windows is installed).

Next to the drive you want to use, click "Turn on BitLocker."

Step 3: Pick a way to unlock it
You will be asked by BitLocker how you wish to unlock the drive. Some choices are:

Password

Smart card

PIN (with TPM)

USB key to start up

Choose your method and move on.

Step 4: Make a copy of your recovery key
If you forget your password or can't get to your data, BitLocker gives you a recovery key to get to it. There are a number of ways to back it up:

Save to your account with Microsoft

Put it on a USB drive

Store it in a file on a different drive

Make a copy of the recovery key

Make sure this key is kept safe. It's the only way to get your encrypted data back if something goes wrong.

Step 5: Pick the Encryption Mode
There are two modes in BitLocker:

XTS-AES is the best new encryption option for internal disks.

Compatible mode (AES-CBC): Works with external or detachable drives

Choose your drive type and then click Next.

Step 6: Begin the encryption process
Check your settings and then click "Start Encrypting." The process could take a while, depending on how big the drive is and how fast the system is.

How to Turn on BitLocker Without TPM
You have to turn on BitLocker through Group Policy if your device doesn't have TPM:

To open gpedit.msc, use Win + R, type it in, then hit Enter.

Go to: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Operating System Drives

Double-click on Require more authentication at startup.

Click "Enabled" and tick the box next to "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM."

After clicking OK, restart your computer.

Now, using the procedures above, try to turn on BitLocker again.

Checking to see if BitLocker is active
To make sure BitLocker is on:

Run Command Prompt as an administrator

Type: manage-bde -status

It should mention "On" under "Protection Status."

You can also check how far along the encryption is and what kind of drive it is.

Best Things to Do After Activation
After you turn on BitLocker, use these recommendations to make sure your encryption stays strong:

Keep backup recovery keys in a few safe places.

Allow systems to lock themselves when not in use

Change group policies to control settings on more than one user or corporate device.

To encrypt USB or external drives, use BitLocker To Go.

Check the encryption status often to make sure the protection is still on.

Also, make sure your operating system is always up to date to keep it safe and compatible.

Fixing common problems with activation
There are situations when BitLocker activation doesn't work right. Here's how to fix typical problems:

TPM not found: Make sure that TPM is turned on in BIOS/UEFI.

BitLocker options that are greyed out: You probably have Windows Home. Upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

Prompts for the recovery key every time you boot: Check to see if BIOS upgrades are needed or reconfigure TPM

Encryption is stuck or doesn't work: Try again after running chkdsk /f to inspect the disk.

Last Thoughts
Turning on BitLocker encryption, or more correctly, activating your BitLocker account, is a good way to keep your digital information safe. At first, the process may appear complicated, but Windows has a guided setup that makes it easy for most people to follow. When you turn on BitLocker, you can relax since you know your data is safe, even if someone else gets your device.

Take the time to keep your recovery key safe, know how to use your encryption settings, and check on the condition of your disk on a regular basis. BitLocker makes data security both strong and easy to use.
